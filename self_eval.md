# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I was really excited doing these problems. I felt like I had a really good understanding I was really succcessful completing the homework... Then I got to the last problem on the final_practice sheet and could not figure out what I was doing wrong. I am still proud of the rest of my work though.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Methods save time by allowing the user to reuse code without having to retype it.
